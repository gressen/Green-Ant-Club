# DMAIC

DMAIC is a methodology for solving large scale problems. It's an acronym for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control. DMAIC is driven by data and it let's you improve a process in a structured and well-defined fashion.

See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMAIC) for more info.

The following overview will present the 5 phases of the method using an example problem - global warming.
The phases usually need to come in a sequence. Next phase should only be started once the previous phase is complete to avoid unnecessary rework in the later stages.

## Define
[Global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming) is a long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth. It is known for decades to be the most pressing issue of the planet. In terms of sustainability it's a major factor contributing to drastic destabilisation of the planet's ecosystems.
